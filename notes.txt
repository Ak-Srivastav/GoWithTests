We can check percentage of code covered and it's severity By running test using 'run with coverage'.
or
(in terminal)
ENVIRONMENT=test go test -count 1 -timeout 7m -p 1 -covermode count -coverprofile code-coverage.out -v ./...
This will create a file code-coverage.out

For Visualization:
go tool cover -html=code-coverage.out
